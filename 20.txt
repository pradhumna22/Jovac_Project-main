A binary tree and a number k are given. Print every path in the tree with sum of the nodes in the path as k. 
A path can start from any node and end at any node and must be downward only, i.e. they need not be root node and leaf node; and negative numbers can also be there in the tree.
Examples: 
 

Input : k = 5  
        Root of below binary tree:
           1
        /     \
      3        -1
    /   \     /   \
   2     1   4     5                        
        /   / \     \                    
       1   1   2     6    
                       
Output :
3 2 
3 1 1 
1 3 1 
4 1 
1 -1 4 1 
-1 4 2 
5 
1 -1 5
